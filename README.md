`epoxy` uses the following emerging Web standards:

- MutationObserver
- WeakMap
- Object.observe

## Usage

```js
    epoxy.bind(target, data)
```

## Syntax

#### Variables

```html
    <input type="checkbox" checked="{{ todo.isDone }}" />
    <input type="text" value="{{ todo.task }}" />
```

#### Repeat

```html
    <ul>
      <template repeat="{{ todos }}">
        <li>{{ task }}</li>
      </template>
    </ul>
```

#### If

```html
  <template if="{{ todos.length }}">
    You have {{ todos.length }} todos left.
  </template>
```

You can also combine `if` and `repeat`.

#### Unless

```html
  <template unless="{{ todos.length }}">
    Well done, you have no todos left!
  </template>
```

You can also combine `unless` and `repeat`.
